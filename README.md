## Laser Cut Prototype Keyboard Switch Plate
### Predesigned Default ZX81 Layout File
Use the zx81-default-plate.dxf file in this repository as is with a laser cutter at your local makerspace, on your own laser cutter, or with a laser cutting service provider.

### Make Your Own Custom Laser Cut Switch Plate Layout
If you wish to create your own prototype keyboard switch plate CAD file for laser cutting:
1. Goto [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) and design your own layout, or use the [ZX81 Default Layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/118732cf454657a0e314288b18740382) that I created.
1. Click on the "</> Raw data" tab to select & copy the generated JSON layout data to your clipboard.
1. Paste the generated JSON layout data from the above step into the "Plate Layout" input of [swillkb's Plate & Case Builder](http://builder.swillkb.com/).
1. Select your switch type, stabilizers, case, etc.
1. Click on the "Draw My CAD" button, or you can order the plate from lasergist.
1. If you selected "Draw My CAD", you should get directed to a page with the plate drawing shown as specified along with three buttons to download either an SVG, DXF, or EPS file.
1. Use the downloaded file with a laser cutter at your local makerspace or on your own laser cutter.

## Water-Transfer Decal File
Use the zx81-default-layout-single-set.svg file to print onto a "white backed" non-transparent waterslide decal paper. Make sure to use a decal application/treating solution as mentioned in [ZX81/TIMEX-SINCLAIR 1000 Custom Mechanical Keyboard Prototype - Part 2](https://blog.codesurfer.dev/zx81-timex-sinclair-1000-custom-mechanical-keyboard-prototype-part-2/)
